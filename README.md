# Classifying-DNA-Binding-Proteins-using-GRU-Bi-LSTM-and-CapsNet

Abstract
Identifying DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) through their primary sequences is challenging in the field of genomic annotation. DBPs play a pivotal role in a host of cellular functions, including the replication, transcription, splicing, and repair of DNA. Certain DBPs are crucial for the development of treatments for a variety of human malignancies and immune disorders. Presently, experimental techniques to classify DBPs are labour-intensive and costly. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the invention of accurate computational methods to deal with this problem. This study introduces a novel deep learning framework integrating The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory), and 1D-Capsule Network to predict DBPs from protein sequences. Initially, we transform the protein sequences into one-hot encoded data as an input for GRU and then into word2vec data as an input for Bi-LSTM. Then, the results from both models are combined, and a 1D-CapsNet is used to extract the relationship between features and function as a classifier. The proposed model performs better in predicting DBPs than several previous methods.
